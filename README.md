# SPG

##### Getting Started

1. Clone Repo
2. Run `nodemon app.js`
  Your port should be listening
3. Make sure you have the basic things setup...
  * [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) installed
  * [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/) installed
  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `DATABASE` in your `.env` file, which should be store in the outer most directory... root directory.. is that what it is called? You will likely have to create it, because this is a `.gitignore`d file (as it should be).

#### Quick Overview:

As of right now, the folder is still changing quite a bit... there is no front end side to it yet, lol, but the architecture is just MV(c) right now.
